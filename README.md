# Gillespie_SSA
R code for my Master's Stochastics coursework - the SSA Gillespie algorithm which provides a way to simulate chemical reactions.
The R code doesn't really make any sense without looking through the pdf.
Not really a huge coding project but shows off some cool stats and was good fun to do, also not backed up anywhere else.
